<h2><i> Chapter 6: Long Lasting Love</i></h2>
<h3>Scene 3: Journey to a Bright Life</h3>
<p>"Ladies and gentleman, university officials, fellow graduates, parents, and all guests, good afternoon" he coughed smirking. <br>He killed the thought and proceeded with his speech.<br>
--
<br>
"Today ends our college life and begins our new life. This is officially our real life. <br>After 4 years in this university, let's ask ourselves, did we really learn a thing that would prepare us to live our real life?"<br><br>

Then audience suddenly became quiet and attentive. Some are fixed their sitting positions, while some has obviously started asking them the question.<br><br>

"For my case, I would say that I have learned a very big thing that I need to face my new and real life. <br>Academically, some of you would say, obviously you did. But, the most important thing I've learned is to Hold on to what you love"<br><br>

People then became more attentive than ever.<br><br>

"I was in love with someone on this hall before. Because our relationship started with lies and pretentions, it ended up right away. <br>It killed me, the whole me. At the same time, it thought me the most essential lesson so far. <br>Hold on to what makes you happy, what makes you smile, what inspires you, to what you love."
